# Thoughtful Food

## Overview

Thoughtful Food is a client-side app powered by Firebase and Firestore that leverages crowdsourced data to help users discover places to eat that meet their dietary needs! This was a project for COMP 1800 at at BCIT.

---

## Features

- Filter local restaraunts by dietary tags.
- Favorite local restaraunts
- Create post about local places to eat
- Get directions from your current location

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Backend**: Firebase for hosting
- **Database**: Firestore

---

## Usage

To run the application locally:

1.  **Clone** the repository.
2.  **Install dependencies** by running `npm install` in the project root directory.
3.  **Start the development server** by running the command: `npm run dev`.
4.  Open your browser and visit the local address shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar).

This project uses Firebase Firestore as its database. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

Database Creation

-Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
-Navigate to Firestore Database and click Create Database.
-Choose Production Mode (recommended) or Test Mode.
-Select a location (e.g., us-central1) and click Enable.

Collections Setup

You will need to create the following collections:
-users: To store user profile data.
-restaurants: To restaurant location and details for the map.
-posts: To store post data.

Environment Configuration

-Create a .env file in the root directory and populate it with your Firebase and Geoapify credentials:
-env
-VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
-VITE_FIREBASE_AUTHDOMAIN="your://firebaseapp.com"
-VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
-VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your_app_id"

-VITE_GEOAPIFY_KEY="your_geoapify_api_key

Once the application is running:

1.  Create an account so you user information is saved 
2.  Either look at the map to find a place to eat using the filters or look at post for an idea of where to go
3.  If you find a place you really love add it to your favorites

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations

- Limited Restaraunt details and limitied Restaraunts
- Accessibility features need to be added.
